# Dalhousie---Machine-Learning-with-Big-Data Course:

Goals of the Course:
--------------------

* Exposure to the basic components of the Big Data science
* Hands-on experience with some of the data tools used for Big Data
* Enabling self-study of advanced concepts in the Big Data context

Course Description:
-------------------
* In this course, the focus was on Big Data and the pillars of that emerging discipline: machine learning/data mining, and elements of high-performance computing, data visualization, and data privacy. 
* Significant part of the course will be devoted to selected, efficient methods for building models from data using machine learning techniques. 
* In high-performance computing, there was a discussion on the cloud from the perspective of the Map-Reduce paradigm, and how to engineer Machine Learning algorithms for Map-reduce.
* Learnt the fundamentals of data visualization as a new paradigm for data exploration.
* Lastly, the course was wrapped with the discussion of the basic legal and technical issued related to protection of data privacy in the Big Data context.

Project and Assignment:
-----------------------

### Project (Classification on GeoSpatial Dataset):

In this project, have applied the concept of feature engineering for pre-processing and cleaning of the data.  After pre-processing of the data, it was heirarchically classified into a tree structure. Further applied classification algorithm such as Random Forest, Decision Tree on the heirarchical tree structure classified data as well as flat structured data. Compare model for tree structure as well as flat structure yusing statistical t-test.

### Assignment (Classification on Animals Daraset):

In this assignment, classification algorithms such as **logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and
na√Øve Bayes classifier** are modeled on the dataset using **scikitlearn** package of python. The results of the classifiers have been evaluated using cross-validation technique and statistical t-test.

Thanks to Dr. Stan Matwin for desiging and teaching the course well.
