# GeoSpatial-Data-Classification

In this project, have applied the concept of feature engineering for pre-processing and cleaning of the data. After pre-processing of the data, it was hierarchically classified into a tree structure by exploring the data to find the relation among the classes. Further applied classification algorithm such as Random Forest, Decision Tree on the hierarchical tree structure classified data as well as flat structured data. Compare model for tree structure as well as flat structure using statistical t-test.

DataSet:
--------
Use the provided Geolife dataset. The target variable is the last column in the CSV file. Each row in the file labeled with one of the following categories:
1 bus (29%)
2 car (11%)
3 walk (36%)
4 taxi (5%)
5 subway (7%)
6 train (12%)
<br />
Other information about the dataset:
* Number of trajectory points: 4.485.796
* Number of classes: 6

Packages Required:
------------------
* **Numpy:** multidimensional arrays, vector and matrix operations
* **Pandas:** data manipulation and analysis
* **Scikit-learn:** machine learning library for classification, regression, clustering, feature selection and much more.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For plotting the graphs.
